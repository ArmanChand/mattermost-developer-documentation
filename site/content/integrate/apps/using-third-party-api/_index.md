There are two examples here to illustrate the [OAuth2](#hello-oauth2) and [webhook](#hello-webhooks) support.

### [Hello, Oauth2 example]({{< ref hello-oauth2 >}})


## Hello Webhooks!

This is an example of an HTTP app ([source](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-apps/tree/master/examples/go/hello-webhooks)), written in Go and runnable on http://localhost:8080.
